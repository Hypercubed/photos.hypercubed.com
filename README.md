# Official site for photos.hypercubed.com.

This is a experimental WIP.

The web-site uses [DocPad](https://github.com/bevry/docpad) for static site generation and [docpad-plugin-feedr](https://github.com/docpad/docpad-plugin-feedr/) for reading retreiving a list of photos from 500px.

## Running local web-site instance

1. [Install DocPad](https://github.com/bevry/docpad)

1. Clone the project and run the server

	``` bash
	git clone git://github.com/Hypercubed/photos.hypercubed.com.git
	cd photos.hypercubed.com
	npm install
	docpad run
	```

1. [Open http://localhost:9778/](http://localhost:9778/)

1. Start hacking away by modifying the `src` directory
